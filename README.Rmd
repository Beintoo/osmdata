`osmdata` is an R package for accessing the raw vector data underlying OpenStreetMap (OSM) via the
[Overpass API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API).
(Other packages such as [`OpenStreetMap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OpenStreetMap/index.html) can be used to download raster tiles based on OSM data.)
The Overpass
API (or OSM3S) is a read-only API that serves up custom selected
parts of the OSM map data. Map data can be returned either as
[Simple Features (`sf`)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf) or
[Spatial (`sp`)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp) objects.


### Installation

To install (note that the CRAN version does not currently work with the Overpass API):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Install from CRAN 
install.packages("osmdata")

# Alternatively, install the development version
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/osmdata")
```

To load the package and check the version:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(osmdata)
packageVersion("osmdata")
```

### Usage

[Overpass API](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) queries can be
built from a base query constructed with `opq` followed by `add_osm_feature`. The
corresponding OSM objects are then downloaded and converted to `R Simple
Features (sf)` objects with `osmdata_sf()` or to `R Spatial (sp)` objects with
`osmdata_sp()`. For example,

```{r query-thames, eval=FALSE}
x <- opq(bbox = c(-0.27, 51.47, -0.20, 51.50)) %>% # Chiswick Eyot in London, U.K.
    add_osm_feature(key = 'name', value = "Thames", value_exact = FALSE) %>%
    osmdata_sf()
x
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
msg <- c ("Object of class 'osmdata' with:\n",
"                 $bbox : 51.47,-0.27,51.5,-0.2\n",
"        $overpass_call : The call submitted to the overpass API\n",
"                 $meta : metadata including timestamp and version numbers\n",
"           $osm_points : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 24548 points\n",
"            $osm_lines : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 2219 linestrings\n",
"         $osm_polygons : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 33 polygons\n",
"       $osm_multilines : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 6 multilinestrings\n",
"    $osm_multipolygons : 'sf' Simple Features Collection with 3 multipolygons")
message (msg)
```

OSM data can also be downloaded in OSM XML format with `osmdata_xml()` and saved
for use with other software.

```r
osmdata_xml(q1, "data.xml")
```

The `XML` document is returned silently and may be passed directly to
`osmdata_sp()` or `osmdata_sf()`

```r
doc <- osmdata_xml(q1, "data.xml")
x <- osmdata_sf(q1, doc)
```

Or data can be read from a previously downloaded file:

```r
x <- osmdata_sf(q1, "data.xml")
```

### Style guide

We appreciate any contributions; those that comply with our general coding style
even more. In four short points:

1. `<-` not `=`
2. Indent with four spaces
3. Be generous with other white spaces - you've got plenty of real estate on
   that big screen of yours.
4. Code is much easier to read when braces are vertically aligned, so please
   put `{` in the same vertical position as `}`.

### Citation

```{r}
citation ("osmdata")
```
